# Tracer
Background application logger, used for a computer club. 

Given a list of applications to monitor, it will log to a network "server" stats about their usage (user, time started/closed, etc)

Coded in 1998 in C++ Builder 5 as part of the [summer practice at the end of the 4th year at university](https://github.com/stefandee/university-years/tree/main/src/year-4/practica)

Coming to think of, I'm not sure if the computer club ended up using it and they never asked me for updates/bug-fixes.

## Setup&Build&Run

Requires Borland C++ Builder 5. Newer in the suite might work too, but...why?

APPList.txt must be placed in the Windows installation folder (e.g. C:\Windows)
